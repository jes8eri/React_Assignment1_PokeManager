/**TODO: 
 * Divide App into smaller components (ex Routing).

 * Decide on fonts. 
 * Icon / images assets.
 *  
 * Pagination component for easier page creation?
 * 
 * Add to team/remove from team functionality
 * Inform user when trying to add pokemon to full team
 * Edit name in detailed-team-view-modal?
 * 
 * API stuff
 *    - Pokemon states, list of pokemons (next, prev button), selected pokemon, retrieve more data from api when clicking on "i for info"-button.
 *    - "Loading" 
 * 
 * CSS stuff

      - icons + favicon
 *    - "Root"-css file with default colours/fonts, import into other css-files.
 *    - Selected NavLink styling (moving pokeball?)
 * 
 *    - Pokemon "card" to display info when clicked.
 *      Modal? Lift to top level state to reuse easier, plus cover entire screen?
 
 *    - Browse Pokemon view - SearchBar in fitting box on top, larger box underneath with 25/50 pokemon per "next/prev"-page.
 *    - Style scrollbar in index.css
 * 
 *    Modal: reuse the pokemonmodal. Add buttons for /removefromteam/editname, hide unless the modal opens from teambuilder. +reserved space for "your team appears to be full"
 *    pass addtoteam+removefromteam functions down to modal component for use in both browsepokemon+teambuilder views
 *    picture url in state to save as semi caching?
 *    
 *    nickname - store original name and allow user to revert with button
 *    navbar outside header, fixed, smaller?
 *    navbar same background as content, so it looks like it fits with content instead of header, rounded borders on top
